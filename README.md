Face Detection Project
This project utilizes JavaScript to perform face detection, and it can identify age, gender, and emotion. It employs the face-api.js library, which is a powerful tool for performing face detection and recognition tasks directly in the browser with TensorFlow.js.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a modern web browser that supports JavaScript and has TensorFlow.js capabilities. You will also need a local server to serve the files.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd face-detection-project
Start a local server. If you have Python installed, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
python -m http.server
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or whichever port your server is running on).
Usage
Upload an image by clicking on the "Upload Image" button.
After uploading, the image will be displayed, and face detection will be performed.
Age, gender, and emotion of detected faces will be shown below the image.
Demo
You can check out the live demo here.
